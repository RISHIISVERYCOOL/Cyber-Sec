These are the personal and academic projects that I have completed throughout my college journey to acquire new skills, concepts, technologies, languages, and more, to motivate me to grow knowledgeably in the field of blue teaming.

# [ SOC-30: Day Challeneges ](https://github.com/RISHIISVERYCOOL/Cyber-Sec/tree/main/SOC-30%20Day%20Challenege)
This training helped me gain knowledge not only theoretically but also practically, to immerse myself in real-world challenges and help me understand what an SOC Analyst goes through in their daily routine. It helped me explore various topics in the field of SOC Analysis, which are Windows Event Management and analysis using **Windows Event Viewer**, Linux Log Analysis using **Splunk**, Packet Analysis & Network Protocols using **Wireshark**, Phishing-Malware Analysis & Threat Intelligence using **OSINT tools**, **MITRE ATT&CK** &  EDR using **Wazooh**.
